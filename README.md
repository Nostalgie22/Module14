# the performance of the baseline trading algorithm ,in conclusion this baseline perform very well during the periode with set of 3 months and the windows used 4 and 100.
# What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing the SMA windows? by increasing the short windows from 4 days  to 10 days,the price trend is positive because the the short widows is greater than long window.
#  What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing the training window? 
# the cumulative product of the actual returns vs. the strategy returns after adjustment the both returns improved.between 2020 and 2021 we noticed that the two returns were dowm later in 2021 they went up again.
# Did this new model perform better or worse than the provided baseline model?  Did this new model perform better or worse than your tuned trading algorithm? comparing both before any adjustment the logistic regression has a lower accuracy than the SVM model however the model has lower recall score for 1 which is not for prediction.the SVM perform better than the logistic regression.
# Did this new model perform better or worse than your tuned trading algorithm? after adjustment the both model has the same accuracy and the recall score for the 1 are aalmost the same for both.both model perform the same.
